                        Every foot looks different. Although there are feet which have an identical size in foot length, 
                        they might have different foot width and height. However, most of the ready-made shoes sold on stores 
                        are discriminated only by foot lengths for convenience which results in giving unsatisfying experience to customers. 
                        One way for the customers not to get stressed from this dissatisfaction is to buy custom-made shoes, but it is often 
                        discouraged since it requires more time and cost than ready-made ones.

                        I conducted initial market research to know the present situation of the shoemaking industry. 
                        To sum up, I found out that the domestic shoe industry of men’s bespoke shoes had constantly 
                        been growing its sales for over a decade. In spite of the growing interest in bespoke shoes of customers, 
                        it was focused on online sales rather than those of offline due to lack of three factors: 
                        accessibility, promotion, and differentiation.

                        I conducted further research by interviewing and surveying customers who had purchased shoes both online and offline shops. 
                        What is worth noticing was that many customers replied that they are unwilling to shop at offline shops, mostly because of 
                        the lack of shoe designs. Besides, for some customers who bought their shoes at online stores, it was an unpleasant experience 
                        since the material and shape of the shoes were different from what they imagined.

                        It was also important to hear the voice of shoemakers, especially those who run a small business, 
                        in that they can provide diversity in shoe designs. Through in-depth interviews, I figured out that one of the biggest problems 
                        of the small business owners in making shoes is limited use of tools since there was not enough space to keep all items, 
                        particularly the shoe last.
